# scimoji - a proposal for using emoji in science

## Why?
That's quite simple:
1. I've seen **lots** of Pubmed-based chat rants and wars
2. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of'em
3. It'll (I hope) save time and cognitive resources on scale if used, being subject to [Metcalfe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) 🤔
